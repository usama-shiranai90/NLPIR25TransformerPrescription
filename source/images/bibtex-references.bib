Existing work either uses complicated rule-based protocols which are hard to implement and maintain, or simple statistical models that treat each disease independently, which may lead to sub-optimal or even harmful drug combinations. In this work, we propose the LEAP (LEArn to Prescribe) algorithm to decompose the treatment recommendation into a sequential decision making process while automatically determining the appropriate number of medications. A recurrent decoder is used to model label dependencies and content-based attention is used to capture label instance mapping. We further leverage reinforcement learning to fine tune the model parameters to ensure accuracy and completeness. We incorporate external clinical knowledge into the design of the reinforcement reward to effectively prevent generating unfavorable drug combinations. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies are conducted on two real world electronic health record datasets to verify the effectiveness of our solution. On both datasets, LEAP significantly outperforms baselines by up to 10-30% in terms of mean Jaccard coefficient and removes 99.8% adverse drug interactions in the recommended treatment sets.},

To manage these errors and minimize their seriousness , healthcare professionals follow a collaborative management process that relies on reporting and then analyzing the reports filled in by them via various reporting tools, both digital and paper-based. These tools can be customized requiring specific information to be entered in multiple forms with commonly the presence of textual descriptions to fill in a free-text field. Therefore , text analysis is crucial for thoroughly understanding and effectively analyzing medication errors. Given the large volume of reports to be quickly processed, it is essential to help healthcare professionals prioritize which ME to analyze.

A prescription assistant may be able to provide immediate guidance on drug combinations for some urgent clinical situations. A well-controlled drug-drug interaction (DDI) rate and high recommendation precision are of great importance for a safe prescription. A lower DDI often implies the set of drug combinations should be as small as possible, which is challenging because EMR prescriptions for certain symptom(s) are often highly noised due to the diversity side symptoms of individuals. We propose a model comprised of cycle transformers (CycleTrans) to handle these challenges. CycleTrans employs cross-attention and transformers, integrates patients' longitudinal EMRs, enhances knowledge representations through the so-called cycle-embedding module, and thus predicts safer and better essential drug combinations for new-coming cases. The new model achieves the state-of-the-art in three dimensions: high precision (89%), low DDI rate (0.34%), and small drug set size (3.02) on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset, surpassing previous bests of 73%, 5%, and 17 in each dimension, respectively. Such a significant advancement makes a much safer clinic prescription possible. The idea of the cycle transformer we proposed has considerable potential for other domains besides clinics, such as set recommendations, translation, and unsupervised representation learning in knowledge graphs.},

Currently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for complicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it's difficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors. This urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help treat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions. Due to the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research interests. Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a multi-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper, we propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel copy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient, the proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and medication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses. Then in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a medicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one. This process is quite similar to the decision process of human doctors. We validate the proposed model on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

This study explores how integrating domain knowledge with large language models (LLMs)—capable of sophisticated text interpretation and generation—can reduce these errors. We introduce MEDIC (medication direction copilot), a system that emulates the reasoning of pharmacists by prioritizing precise communication of core clinical components of a prescription, such as dosage and frequency. It fine-tunes a first-generation LLM using 1,000 expert-annotated and augmented directions from Amazon Pharmacy to extract the core components and assembles them into complete directions using pharmacy logic and safety guardrails. We compared MEDIC against two LLM-based benchmarks: one leveraging 1.5 million medication directions and the other using state-of-the-art LLMs. On 1,200 expert-reviewed prescriptions, the two benchmarks respectively recorded 1.51 (confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 2.31) and 4.38 (CI 3.13, 6.64) times more near-miss events—errors caught and corrected before reaching the patient—than MEDIC. Additionally, we tested MEDIC by deploying within the production system of an online pharmacy, and during this experimental period, it reduced near-miss events by 33% (CI 26%, 40%). This study shows that LLMs, with domain expertise and safeguards, improve the accuracy and efficiency of pharmacy operations. Tailored to detect and prevent potential medication direction errors in a digital pharmacy data processing pipeline, a large language model is shown to increase efficiency and decrease burden for technicians and pharmacists in a prospective application.},

   abstract = {Medicine recommendation systems are designed to aid healthcare professionals by analysing a patient's admission data to recommend safe and effective medications. These systems are categorised into two types: instance-based and longitudinal-based. Instance-based models only consider the current admission, while longitudinal models consider the patient's medical history. Electronic Health Records are used to incorporate medical history into longitudinal models. This project proposes a novel Knowledge Graph-Driven Medicine Recommendation System using Graph Neural Networks, KGDNet, that utilises longitudinal EHR data along with ontologies and Drug-Drug Interaction knowledge to construct admission-wise clinical and medicine Knowledge Graphs for every patient. Recurrent Neural Networks are employed to model a patient's historical data, and Graph Neural Networks are used to learn embeddings from the Knowledge Graphs. A Transformer-based Attention mechanism is then used to generate medication recommendations for the patient, considering their current clinical state, medication history, and joint medical records. The model is evaluated on the MIMIC-IV EHR data and outperforms existing methods in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard score, and Drug-Drug Interaction control. An ablation study on our models various inputs and components to provide evidence for the importance of each component in providing the best performance. Case study is also performed to demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of KGDNet. Medicine recommendation has been an important area of research in the last few years. The purpose of medicine recommendation systems is to assist healthcare professionals to analyse a patient's admission data regarding diagnoses, illnesses, medical procedures to prescribe a set safe and accurate medications that will help in mitigating the patient's illness. These systems prove to be especially useful when patients are diagnosed with multiple illnesses and undergo several procedures during their stay. However, as doctors and researchers discover new diseases and develop new medicines and procedures, they have to take a number of factors into account while recommending medicines to a patient. Firstly, they have to consider the patient's medical history while prescribing medication for the current admission. Medicine recommendation models can be divided into two categories, instance-based and longitudinal-based. Instance-based models provide medicine recommendations by taking only the current admission record into account 1,2. These models do not consider the patient's medical history and hence cannot take into consideration any previous diagnoses and medications that could affect the recommendations. This affects the accuracy and effectiveness of such models. Recently, to address these issues, longitudinal-based recommendation methods such as 3-7 have been proposed, which leverage the temporal dependencies present in the patient's medical history to provide personalised and safer recommendations. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are used to incorporate medical history into longitudinal-based models. EHRs like MIMIC 8,9 systematically collect historical medical information of a patient including diagnoses, procedures, prescription among others in the form of medical codes across admissions 2,10. Secondly, they have to take into consideration the presence of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) 11 between different pairs of medicines. According to National Institutes of Health, DDIs can "change a drug's effect on the body when the drug is taken together with a second drug". These pairs may interact affect the action of either or both drugs and lead to adverse reactions which can deteriorate a patient's health condition 12,13. For example, a},

However, due to the limitations of the EMRs’ content, recommendation systems cannot explicitly reflect relevant medical data, such as drug interactions. In recent years, medicine recommendation approaches based on medical knowledge graphs and graph neural networks have been proposed, and the methods based on the Transformer model have been widely used in medicine recommendation systems. Transformer-based medicine recommendation approaches are readily applicable to inductive problems. Unfortunately, traditional Transformer-based medicine recommendation approaches require complex computing power and suffer information loss among the multi-heads in Transformer model, which causes poor performance. At the same time, these approaches have rarely considered the side effects of drug interaction in traditional medical recommendation approaches. To overcome the drawbacks of the current medicine recommendation approaches, we propose a Star Interactive Enhanced-based Transformer (SIET) model. It first constructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMR (MIMIC-III) and a medical knowledge graph (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, based on the constructed heterogeneous graph, it extracts a disease homogeneous graph, a medicine homogeneous graph, and a negative factors homogeneous graph to get auxiliary information of disease or drug (named enhanced neighbors). These are fed into the SIET model in conjunction with the relevant information in the EMRs to obtain representations of diseases and drugs. It finally generates the recommended drug list by calculating the cosine similarity between disease combination representations and drug combination representations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III, DrugBank, and ICD-9 ontology datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed model. Meanwhile, we show that our SIET model outperforms strong baselines on an inductive medicine recommendation task.},

However, many small hospitals only have a few records, which hinders applying existing medication recommendation works to the real world. Thus, we seek to explore a more practical setting, i.e., multi-center medication recommendation. In this setting, most hospitals have few records, but the total number of records is large. Though small hospitals may benefit from total affluent records, it is also faced with the challenge that the data distributions between various hospitals are much different.

We first design two self-supervised tasks for the pretraining stage to learn general medical knowledge. They are mask prediction and contrastive tasks, which extract the intra-and interrelationships of input diagnosis and procedures. Furthermore, we devise a novel prompt tuning method to capture the specific information of each hospital rather than adopting the common finetuning. On the one hand, the proposed prompt tuning can better learn the heterogeneity of each hospital to fit various distributions. On the other hand, it can also relieve the catastrophic forgetting problem of finetuning. To validate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on the public eICU, a multi-center medical dataset. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model.

To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called LargE languAge moDel distilling mEdication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online 1 .},

   abstract = {Objective Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can reduce medical errors increasing drug prescription appropriateness. Deepening knowledge of existing CDSSs could increase their use by healthcare professionals in different settings (ie, hospitals, pharmacies, health research centres) of clinical practice. This review aims to identify the characteristics common to effective studies conducted with CDSSs. Materials and methods The article sources were Scopus, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and Web of Science, queried between January 2017 and January 2022. Inclusion criteria were prospective and retrospective studies that reported original research on CDSSs for clinical practice support; studies should describe a measurable comparison of the intervention or observation conducted with and without the CDSS; article language Italian or English. Reviews and studies with CDSSs used exclusively by patients were excluded. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was prepared to extract and summarise data from the included articles. Results The search resulted in the identification of 2424 articles. After title and abstract screening, 136 studies remained, 42 of which were included for final evaluation. Most of the studies included rule-based CDSSs that are integrated into existing databases with the main purpose of managing disease-related problems. The majority of the selected studies (25 studies; 59.5%) were successful in supporting clinical practice, with most being pre-post intervention studies and involving the presence of a pharmacist. Discussion and conclusion A number of characteristics have been identified that may help the design of studies feasible to demonstrate the effectiveness of CDSSs. Further studies are needed to encourage CDSS use.},

@article{Iancu2023,
   abstract = {Background: Medication prescription is a complex process that could benefit from current research and development in machine learning through decision support systems. Particularly pediatricians are forced to prescribe medications “off-label” as children are still underrepresented in clinical studies, which leads to a high risk of an incorrect dose and adverse drug effects. Methods: PubMed, IEEE Xplore and PROSPERO were searched for relevant studies that developed and evaluated well-performing machine learning algorithms following the PRISMA statement. Quality assessment was conducted in accordance with the IJMEDI checklist. Identified studies were reviewed in detail, including the required variables for predicting the correct dose, especially of pediatric medication prescription. Results: The search identified 656 studies, of which 64 were reviewed in detail and 36 met the inclusion criteria. According to the IJMEDI checklist, five studies were considered to be of high quality. 19 of the 36 studies dealt with the active substance warfarin. Overall, machine learning algorithms based on decision trees or regression methods performed superior regarding their predictive power than algorithms based on neural networks, support vector machines or other methods. The use of ensemble methods like bagging or boosting generally enhanced the accuracy of the dose predictions. The required input and output variables of the algorithms were considerably heterogeneous and differ strongly among the respective substance. Conclusions: By using machine learning algorithms, the prescription process could be simplified and dosing correctness could be enhanced. Despite the heterogenous results among the different substances and cases and the lack of pediatric use cases, the identified approaches and required variables can serve as an excellent starting point for further development of algorithms predicting drug doses, particularly for children. Especially the combination of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models with machine learning algorithms represents a great opportunity to enhance the predictive power and accuracy of the developed algorithms.},
